                  Born and raised in one of the HOTTEST parts in the world
                  life seemed like a constant battle for shade even though
                  growing up on an Tropical Island surrounded by Turquoise OceanWater, endless waterfalls 
                  and streams that meet the ocean front
                  filled with lush jungles and  mountain ranges as far as the eye can see; 
                  vibing with wild exotic animals of different 
                  species undisturbed from the outside world, life was never a 'B-E-A-C-H'!

                  With my dusty soccer boots and a janky set of shin Pads (which seemed like they were cut out of an old yoga mat) and $20
                  in my pocket;
                  I landed on the beautiful shores of CALI-FOR-NIAYYYYY in August 17th 20007,
                  having no Idea of how America would share its Slice of the American Dream
                  with someone like "ME" I started a journey that has come this far! <img src="images/cool runnings.jfif">

               <p>
                  The journey so far has been a life learning experience to say the very least, but one that I wouldn't change...
                  Here's a look at some of the things I've been up to recently!

                           Cottonwood Pass rises to the west out of Buena Vista, 
                           heading over the Continental Divide. It’s an amazing mountain pass to see colorful fall aspen groves.
                           It connects with Almont near Crested Butte, making it an excellent summer trip. 
                           The road closes in winter due to heavy snowfall, usually sometime in October. 
                           The paved pass reaches 12,126 feet. Originally, just the Buena Vista half of the pass was paved,
                           but in 2017 the Almont side was paved as well. It’s an excellent drive for 2WD cars.
